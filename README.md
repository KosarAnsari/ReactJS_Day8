# 📘 Day 8 - React.js Learning Journey

Welcome to **Day 8** of my React.js learning journey! Today’s focus was on form handling and deepening my understanding of props and controlled components.

## 🔍 What I Learned

### ✅ 1. Default Props
- Used `defaultProps` to assign fallback values to props in functional components.
- Helps in making components more flexible and bug-free.

### 🎨 2. Styling via Wrapper Component
- Used wrapper components to style and group UI elements effectively.
- This promotes reusability and cleaner component design.

### 📝 3. Input Field Handling
- Captured user input using `onChange` and updated state using `useState`.
- Showed real-time input updates.

### 🔄 4. Controlled Components
- Implemented input elements (text, checkbox, radio, and dropdown) whose values are controlled by React state.
- Ensures better control and validation of user input.

### ✅ 5. Checkbox, Radio Button & Dropdown
- Practiced handling:
  - ✅ Checkboxes using boolean state
  - 🔘 Radio buttons with grouped selection
  - ⬇️ Dropdown menus with dynamic options
